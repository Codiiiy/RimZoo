🦓 RimZoo – Build Your Own Zoo in RimWorld! (WIP)

Welcome to RimZoo!
Create, manage, and profit from your very own zoo—RimWorld style!
This is my first RimWorld mod and still a work in progress, so all feedback is truly appreciated.

🌟 Current Features

🏛️ Zoo Exhibits
Designate animal exhibits using a custom Exhibit Marker. Any tame animal can be part of your zoo!

🕒 Opening Hours
Choose when your zoo is open to visitors.

🧠 Custom Interface
Easily manage your zoo with a clean in-game UI designed for intuitive control and tracking.

💰 Visitor Income System
Visitors will pay silver to see your animals! Income depends on:

Animal Happiness – keep them healthy and well-fed!

Animal Rarity – the more exotic, the better the payout.

😊 Animal Happiness System
Each animal’s happiness is influenced by:

Overall health

Pen size

Hunger level

Unhappy animals may go maddened!
➡️ How to Get Started:
Make a pen like you would for farm animals, but use an Exhibit Marker instead of a Pen Marker.
Then… wait for guests and watch the silver roll in!

🔨 Work in Progress

This mod is still growing! Planned features include:

Guest viewing zones

Pen beauty contributing to happiness

Unique zoo-related events

UI expansion and polish
